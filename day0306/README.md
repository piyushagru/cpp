#Day6
#Day7
This year is the worst of all and the things that hurts the most is, there is nothing much that we can do about it.
Nisarga(Cyclone) is on its ways, after around 20 years this is expected to be the most dangerous cyclone to hit the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujrat.
I live around the area, and therefore most probably I wont be able to post question and solutions tommorow due to no electricity and obvious reasons, 
but this should not affect or hit your streak of solving problems,so I will be posting problems for the next two days.

LeetCode Problems
- [x] Code 413
- [x] Code 1277
- [x] Code 740
- [x] Both day's June challenge

The reading material is not yet planned as I have decided to switch to DBMS and these kind of shifts would be regular as
 I dont want anyone to get bored with just one subject.

These 2 days you have a good chance to clear your stack of unsolved problems as the burden is low.

Happy learning
